Intelligent Traffic Management System
This project uses Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to simulate an adaptive traffic signal system. It aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve road safety using reinforcement learning.

Features
Real-time traffic light control using AI

Vehicle detection (simulated LiDAR)

Visual simulation using Pygame

Reduced average vehicle wait time and improved signal efficiency
